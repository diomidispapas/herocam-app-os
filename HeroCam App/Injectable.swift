/**
 *  Dependency injection is a software design pattern that implements Inversion of Control for resolving dependencies. Following thi pattern, ```Injectable```  protocol helps the app split into loosely-coupled components, which can be developed, tested and maintained more easily. A component that needs to be injected with a value, implements the protocol and we must check after initialization that the dependecies are in place, using the ```assertDependencies()``` function.
